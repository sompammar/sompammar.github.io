If you are using Oracle Data Visualization and want to embed a dashboard created into a custom web application [Oracle Jet](https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/jet/index.html), you can refer to this site. It also has a sample Oracle Jet application and a sample visualization that you can import into your Oracle DV environment.
